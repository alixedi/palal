There are too many choices to begin with. On top of that, there is the vocabulary that reads like English without making any sense.\r\n\r\nThe situation is unacceptable and it hurts FOSS. \r\n\r\nPalal aims to resolve that. It is a simple CLI utility that asks the user a series of questions In-Plain-English and returns the best possible FOSS license for his/her project.\r\n\r\nPalal is inspired by the choosealicense.com and it uses the same license meta-data. However, while choosealicense.com displays the meta-data for the given license, Palal returns the license for the given meta-data.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nSimple. ::\r\n\r\n    $ pip install palal\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nChoosing a FOSS license is easier than ever before. Just run *palal* and type a number from **1** to **5** for each criterion - specifying how important you feel it is for your project. ::\r\n\r\n    $ palal\r\n\r\n    What should be forbidden by your license?\r\n    \r\n    Use Trademark (While this may be implicitly true of all licenses, \r\n    this license explicitly states that you may NOT use the names, logos, \r\n    or trademarks of contributors.)

As with the Unlicense and typical software licenses, CC0 disclaims \r\n    warranties. CC0 is very similar to the Unlicense.\r\n\r\n    Create a text file (typically named LICENSE or LICENSE.txt) in the root of \r\n    your source code and copy the text of the CC0 into the file.\r\n\r\n    http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
